# Text-summarizer
This project demonstrates text-summarization using Spacy. The text-bloc input is first sentence-tokenized and word-tokenized. After that, the word weight of each word is determined by dividing the word frquency of every word with the highest value of word frequency. The sentence score is then found out for all words, 25% of sentences with high sentence scores are selected as summary of the text-bloc input.
